NLP

Abstract
This project aims to predict the rating for a restaurant based on the usersâ€™ review texts alone. We compare and evaluate 4 sentiment analysis/machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-NN, and SVM) based on Word2Vec and Doc2Vec models. The experiment is conducted on the yelp challenge dataset Yelp Challenge Dataset 2017. We figure out that Doc2Vec can produce better predictions on clustering, while it might be computationally unrealistic to be applied in practical sentiment prediction. We also find that for sentiment analysis on the reviews, we can get better results by applying SVM.
